Use blockcypher's API to return the balance of a specific bitcoin testnet address and also make a payment using testnet bitcoins with this API. Create a simple program to run from JavaScript (or nodejs), and upload the code to your github profile as a public repo. Create a simple webpage interface allowing a user to interact with what you've made. James must be able to run your program to return the expected results. You can use "testnet bitcoins" to do the challenge by getting coins from a "bitcoin testnet faucet".

Here are some things you can do to separate yourself from the pack:

- make sure to include useful documentation (a "how to" setup/installation guide)
- ensure your webpage interface is mobile friendly and responsive
- comment your code effectively
- add useful extra features to supplement the core challenge (show off your chartJS skills or display a table of transactions on your webpage)
- use a mySQL database in some way (store transaction data?)
- use proper git workflow

You are being evaluated on the following skills:

- ability to use APIs (GET/POST requests)
- ability to use chartJS or similar framework
- ability to display and query tables of data on a webpage
- ability to work with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- The successful candidate will receive a \$200 "signing bonus" as compensation for the time it takes to undertake this task.
